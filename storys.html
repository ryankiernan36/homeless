	<p>As she talks to me her three-year-old son lies on the bed watching cartoons, interrupting occasionally with enthusiasm.
"Big balloon!" he says at one point.
"Yes, love, big balloon," says Claire.
In their room are a double bed and three single beds divided by small lockers. "We're all in a row, like sardines in a can," Claire says, laughing sadly. Recently in the night her 12-year-old son reached out in his sleep and touched her face. "That's how close the beds are."
She has clothes hanging on a rack by the window. the hotel management doesn't like to see clothes drying elsewhere. "This one room," she says, "it's your sitting room, your bedroom, your kitchen, your laundry room."
Still, she says, it's better than the last room they had in the same hotel. That was damp, which caused her lung problems and left her needing steroids.
Claire says she has had a string of bad luck. She was working for years, but the job came to an end. Before she came here she and her family lived happily for three years in a rented house in a suburb on the other side of the city, where her children are in school. She had to leave because her landlord needed to move in to be near his sick father. When she lost that home she couldn't find anything affordable on rent allowance.
During term time the family are up at 6.30am. The older children take turns getting dressed in the bathroom. They have breakfast in the room, but Claire's youngest can’t eat, because "he'll just get sick on the bus". Her oldest children get two buses to school. Claire goes with them because they’re "not very streetwise". Once they are there she finds a friend who can heat up her youngest son’s breakfast. Then she spends the day walking around, until it’s time to go home.
This year her teenage daughter did her Junior Certificate. "It was hard for her having a three-year-old running around the bed with his trains while she's trying to study."
. Claire was relieved when term ended, partly because of the gruelling routine but also because children at her daughter’s school were beginning to realise that something was up. None of her classmates knows that she’s homeless. "She won’t tell them, because she’s embarrassed," Claire says.
</br>know they are all talking about doing something nice to celebrate the exam results, and she’s worried again.
Cooking is difficult. There is a kitchen, but only one cooker between dozens of families. Tensions can run high. Claire spends a lot of her time walking between her room and the kitchen, waiting for her chance to cook. "The kids end up waiting so long I give them a Pot Noodle or a bowl of cereal."
They sit on their beds eating dinner. At night, all in one room, they have to turn the television off early, so her youngest can sleep. "It sounds like prison doesn’t it?" she says.
	Downstairs is a "play area", but there are no toys in it. "It's just a room." It is beside a smoking area. People sometimes come from the "nice part of the hotel” holding pints, she says. When they see the children "they say, "Hang on, did we come to the wrong place? "
