		 <p>The occupation of an empty office block in Dublin by a group of housing campaigners would highlight the plight of those on the streets but was "not the solution", campaigner Fr Peter McVerry has said.
	He told The Irish Times he would not be lending his support to the occupation of Apollo House because he preferred to channel his energies into finding long-term solutions.
	He doubted whether many rough sleepers would want to stay in the building, which is being redeveloped after loans relating to the property were taken over by Nama.
	"I applaud them in highlighting the issue," said Fr McVerry, who has been working with the homeless and other vulnerable people in Dublin for more than 40 years.
	"Here we have a state-controlled building lying empty while people are sleeping on the streets; it’s a scandal and they are highlighting it.
	"I have no problem with them taking over the building. However, it's not the solution to the homeless crisis, that’s my difficulty and that’s what I won’t join them. I want to focus my energies on campaigning to get a solution.
	however hundreds of activists and republicans believe this is the way and i would have to agree, power to people the goverment didnt care and still dont care about irelands crisis.
